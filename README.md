# capsule_network_TensorFlow
The impending concept of capsule networks has finally arrived at arXiv. link to the publication -> https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829 . In this repository, I'll create an implementation using TensorFlow from scratch as an exercise.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was able to find a few implementations around the internet:
1 -> https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras 
2 -> https://github.com/llSourcell/capsule_networks (This is Siraj Raval)
3 -> https://github.com/debarko/CapsNet-Tensorflow 

If there are any more good ones, feel free to open a pull request! I'd be more that happy to merge :).
